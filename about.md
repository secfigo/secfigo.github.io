I am the senior software security engineer of [ Autodesk, Inc ](http://www.autodesk.com), a fortune 100 MNC, market leader in CAD/CAM. My role is to make sure the Autodesk’s products and services are secure, safe and free from commonly seen client/server side vulnerabilities.

Prior to Autodesk, I was helping [CA Technologies](http://www.ca.com), an enterprise product based company and [TCS](http://tcs.com), a consulting firm, with penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, threat modeling and static application security ( SAST ).

Today, I am responsible for Static Application Security (SAST), Interactive Application Security ( IAST) for entire Autodesk’s product portfolio along with frequent penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. I spearheaded internal hackathons (designed, organize) to train developers in finding web application and thick client application flaws which lead to a substantial improvement in the security posture of Autodesk.

Apart from work related activities, I have a strong passion towards creating/improving information security communities where I live. I have started/leading two security chapters, [null Singapore chapter](http://www.meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community/) and [null Hyderabad chapter](https://www.facebook.com/nullhyd) with 3000+ strong community where in we organized 50+ events and won the Best Chapter Award.
